Recently came across a screencast held at Aloha Ruby Conference. Some of the shortcuts/useful tips mentioned were given below 

###Github
__Adding .diff or .patch to the URL provides more clearer textual representation__

Example: https://github.com/sengopal/sengopal.github.com/commit/c1ed8ca37880bb6b369e5007fa88909aa1b73189
https://github.com/sengopal/sengopal.github.com/commit/c1ed8ca37880bb6b369e5007fa88909aa1b73189.diff
https://github.com/sengopal/sengopal.github.com/commit/c1ed8ca37880bb6b369e5007fa88909aa1b73189.patch

__Remove Whitespace differences using `?w=1`__

__Cool octocat images @ octodex.github.com__

__URL Shortner : git.io__
Usage: `gitio <url> <name?`

__Lexer and Highlighting Languages : [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist "Linguist")__

__Gist as Screenshot sharing and discussion tool `<https://gist.github.com/>`__

__Git + Hub super commands__
Hub is a command line tool that wraps git in order to extend it with extra features and commands that make working with GitHub easier.

__Key Shortcuts__
Press in repo page 
`t` - for File Finder
`w` - branch selector
`s` - quick search

__@mention__ - adds person to the conversation
__@Organization/Team__ - adds the organization/team to the conversation
