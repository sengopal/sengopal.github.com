The following are some of the important points that i had gathered during my learning of CSS and HTML markup. It also contains the important factors to consider when converting a given PSD or image into a good HTML markup and CSS.

###Slicing techniques
1. Do not slice the logo
2. Figure out the gradient for repeating along the x -axis
3. Dont start with the slice tool from the toolbar
4. Always design with a wrapper div - for a row or a column - to be enclosed as a container tag
5. Decide upon only one type of slicing for a given layout - for the wrapper divs and then perform the slicing 
6. First horizontal - because the flow goes from right to left
7. After selecting the slice, divide the slice and give the number of dividers you would need
8. Save for Web and Devices - Gif and PNG for transparent ones
9. Quality generally set up as 75-85%
