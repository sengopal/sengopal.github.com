##Keynote
Amazon web services had arranged for a 1-day expo for customers, partners and enthusiasts alike at Hyatt Regency in Chennai. The main hosts Shane and Janakiram were warm and truly enthusiastic about the turnout for the event. The limelight of the event though was __Dr.Werner Vogel__, the CTO of Amazon and a wonderfully hearty person who enjoyed the keynote and the other interactions as much as the participants.

Some of the customer solutions who had booths set up are Right Scale (who provided a free trial), Cognizant Technology Solutions who were demonstrating their _Logging as a service_ which pulls the logs from app to a private cloud and uses hadoop to analyze the data based on a user query.
