The first software that i always install after a clean OS install is [dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) and this time it was no diiferent, when i installed the new Ubuntu 11.04 Natty. But the panel didnt show the dropbox and me being a newbie was not able to confirm whether it was actually installed or not. 
1. I tried the Lens Search, but it didnt return any results. 
2. Installing it though the software Center didnt bear any fruit.
For some reason, the <http://www.dropbox.com/downloading?os=lnx> gives only the age old version of 0.6.7.

So after some googling, i came across this [dropbox forum post](http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=36538) which pointed to a more recent version and after dpkg - i of that DEB file, i have successfully installed dropbox in Ubuntu Natty. 
The App panel integration looks really slick. Is there some means i can let the Dropbox team know about this old version link. Please let me know your thoughts and comments.
