I am Senthilkumar Gopal, a developer hailing from India. After graduating with a major in Engineering, started with Java based web technologies and coding since then. I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sengopal), [Github](http://github.com/sengopal) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/senthilkumargopal).

I learn most of my technical stuff by myself, starting from 2005, when I first learnt to program in Java. In 2006, I started developing backend services with a bit of Javascript and CSS. In 2010 i joined eBay Inc., and my foray into full fledged product development began from there. I now develop extensive server based code, primarily in Java and loads of front end based applications with JS and CSS, with major focus on responsive web design and better development workflow.

I am not a very enthustiastic blogger, as i write more code than blog posts. However, i enjoy writing with the sense of sharing my thoughts and findings. There are no comments for these blog posts but you are welcome to discuss about anything on this blog on Hacker News or email me at senthil777{at}gmail{dot}com
