I am Senthilkumar Gopal, a developer working at <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>. After graduating with a major in Engineering, started with Java based web technologies and coding since then. I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sengopal), [Github](http://github.com/sengopal) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/senthilkumargopal).


I gained most of my technical know-how by self learning, starting from 2005, when I first learnt to program in Java. In 2006, I started developing backend services with a bit of Javascript and CSS. In 2010 i joined eBay Inc., and my foray into full fledged product development began from there. I now develop extensively on server based development, primarily using Java and client intensive applications with Javascript and CSS, with major focus on responsive web design and better development workflows. 

Recently I moved to the authentication systems team and working extensively on backend architecture, creating the new services authentication protocols, database systems and more. As part of this new position, i have started learning about OAuth 2.0, SAML assertions etc.,

I am not a very enthusiastic blogger, as i write more code than blog posts. However, i enjoy writing with the sense of sharing my thoughts and findings.
