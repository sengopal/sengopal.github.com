I am Senthilkumar Gopal, a developer working at <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>. After graduating with a major in Engineering, started with Java based web technologies and coding since then. I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sengopal), [Github](http://github.com/sengopal) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/senthilkumargopal).


I gained most of my technical know-hoy by self learning, starting from 2005, when I first learnt to program in Java. In 2006, I started developing backend services with a bit of Javascript and CSS. In 2010 i joined eBay Inc., and my foray into full fledged product development began from there. I now develop extensive server based code, primarily in Java and loads of front end based applications with JS and CSS, with major focus on responsive web design and better development workflow. Recently i moved to the authentication systems team and working extensively on backend architecture and token systems and protocols such as OAuth 2.0, SAML assertions etc.,


I am not a very enthusiastic blogger, as i write more code than blog posts. However, i enjoy writing with the sense of sharing my thoughts and findings. There are no comments sections for these blog posts but you are welcome to discuss about anything on this blog on Hacker News or contact me on <a href="http://twitter.com/sengopal">twitter</a> or you can also email <a href="mailto:senthil777@gmail.com">me</a>
