Recently, I came across this oldie, but great article on public speaking on [OReilly](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/social-media/excerpts/9780596802004/public-speaker-butterflies.html). Some of the most important aspects from that article are:

### How to structure the talk
1. Answer most 5 common Questions the audience would have. Structure the talk around it
2. Practice, Dont rehearse
3. Take an interesting angle - Title should define it
4. Create Slides LATE in the process
5. Enjoy yourself

### How to set the title for your presentation
1. 5 weaving skills you can learn today vs. Intro to Basket weaving
2. Important questions about vs. Panel
3. Lessons vs. Analysis

### Be a good listener
1. Pay more attention to people who are listening
2. STOP halfway - ask to ask a question
3. Poll the audience - Never done X? Done it multiple times?
4. Shorten each section - get to Q&A soon - Let audience drive, the better

### Practice, Practive and more Practive
1. Practice is greater than rehearsal. 
2. Aim for comfort, not perfection.

### Quick wins
1. Good to start talks with a story - No intros
2. Warm up act - then the lecture
