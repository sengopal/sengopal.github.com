# Responsive Web Design
Starting with the first coining of the term “Responsive web design” in 2010, RWD has gone from strength to strength as a strong design approach for enabling easier access to web pages in a variety of devices. With a rapid shift in landscape from simple web browsers to rapidly growing list of devices, such as tablets, mobile phones, game controllers to name a few, RWD helps web designers create a flexible but optimized version of the pages best suited for 

Our basic design for the web always centers around a desktop oriented approach and with multiple devices beginning to overrun desktop usage, responsive design forms a strong and simpler means of reaching users with optimal design custom fit for the device in question. Responsive design takes the moral higher ground of creating a connected experience across devices rather than having totally different designs for each and every device.

RWD as an implementation is nothing new and has been possible since CSS 2.1. This presentation goes through how RWD has evolved since then, RWD versus the native app, good and bad usage with few code samples, a simple implementation and next steps.
