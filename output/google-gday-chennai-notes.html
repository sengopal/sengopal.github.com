                <p>Google conducted its first ever gday in India and the first event was held in Chennai Trade Center, Nandambakkam, Chennai. It was a very good crowd of around 1300 technology aspirants ranging from students, freshers, professionals and business folks as well. The keynote was delivered with an enthusiasm of a company who has just released one of the most advanced and sophisticated operating system for mobile - Jelly Bean.</p>
<h2>Welcome Address and Keynote</h2>
<p>The keynote was a great presentation about android, indian internet population and usage, google practices, about google developers group. The interesting practices stressed upon how speed does matter more than instant perfection and new applications should aim to launch fast and often</p>
<p>They also introduced the Chrome mobile and some of its abilities such as sync of tabs open on other devices and how web has evolved into a platform and browser as its OS. There was a Google Docs Collabaration demo where a document was being edited in parallel.</p>
<p><em>Note to myself: checkout the app Beetlab from Chrome Web Store</em></p>
<p>The keynote took a timeline view of how a day starts till end with various technologies working cohesively to achieve the task at hand such as multiple chrome tabs sync, chrome web store and google docs collab, reciept upload and search in images. There was also a Google+ angout demo and an introduction on the hangout apps</p>
<h2>Android 4.1 Jelly Bean Presentation - Divum Software</h2>
<p>The folks from Divum software then presented about the key aspects of the latest Android 4.1 OS - the Jelly bean. They spoke about Project Butter which has enhanced even the performance in menus and chrome, about the support for local lanuguages which can even be pasted into messages as well, about Notifications
and its capabilities ranging upto giving a gallery view of images uploaded. They also spoke about the priority setup for notifications, widget height and width control. Then they introduced Google Now and even had a demo of using <em>Speak "Google" and ask the search term</em>.</p>

<h2>Android Development Workshop - Advanced</h2>
<p>Some of the topics covered or demoed were:</p>
<h3>Connecting to a backend server</h3>
<p>Important points to remember where How to choose a HTTP Client. Since Android provides its own implementation of  <em>HttpClient and HttpURLConnection</em> which supports https as well. The application would need permissions in the manifest file for <strong>INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</strong></p>
<p>Some of the code snippets shown were about using the HttpClient to make an HTTPGet Request and get the data (using new DefaultHttpClient). The code snippets also explained about how to use the HttpResponse and converting into a valid String and using the JSONObject to extract the information from JSON based REST services. Also various XML Parsers available to Android application are DOM Parsers, SAX Parsers, PullParser[recommended] and XmlPullParser.</p>
<p>They also briefly touched upon Fragments which are single piece of code adaptable for various form factors and also about the fragment life cycle.</p>
<p>Some of the newly introduced ICS features were also explained such as Action Bar and Split Action Bar. Also the design paradigm behind the action bar was discussed using the YouTube App's UI Organization. The advantage of using a Stacked ActionBar which acts as a Action Bar + Tabs, it gets mashed into a single bar in a tablet or in the landscape mode.</p>
<h2>Google APIs for MAPS</h2>
<p>The Google Maps API was a little too detailed session with less of demo and more of API detailing. They discussed about the <strong>Google Maps Static API</strong> and its various parameter needs and usage such as depending on https:// the parameters might be different and others. They also explained about the <strong>Google Street View Image API</strong> and the <strong>Google Maps Javascript API V3</strong>.</p>
<p>Some of the demos described about obtaining the API Key at <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/comsole">http://code.google.com/apis/comsole</a> and <strong>Maps Events</strong>. They also described about Overlays and Layers and how the prebuilt aspects such as markers, ploylines, polygons can be used. They also explained about Layers and how they reflect collection of objects that are added on top of the map for association such as weather, traffic, heat maps etc.,</p>
<p>They also briefly touched upon the Direction API, the distance matrix, the elevation data which can be used by trekking and hiking applications, geocoding and street view.</p>
<h2>HTML5</h2>
<p>Guessing by the crowd, this was one of the most anticipated sessions of the day and it truly lived upto the expectations.
The features were divided into 8 categories and presented.</p>
<h4>CSS3</h4>
<p>Some of the features that were explained and demoed were <strong>border-radius, HTML5 slider, box-shadow, text-shadow, text strokes</strong>. Some of the obscure ones were <strong>image cropping (using clip : rect), opacity, columns (using column-count,column-rule,column-gap)</strong>. The demoes extended to <strong>text-wrap (using text-overflow ellipsis,clip), gradients(linear or radial), reflection (box-reflect)</strong>.</p>
<p>There were also demoes on transformations and transitions (this is the effect which describes the time to get the transformation) using <strong>transform,translate,scale,rotate,skew</strong>. They also walked us through creating full fledged animations using @keyframes.</p>
<h4>3D Graphics</h4>
<p>There were great demoes on a **3D CSS cube, a CSS cubic bezier builder and a google chrome logo spin created using a bit of rendering using canvas and vector graphics using svg. There was also a quick note on putting text on a path using svg.</p>
<p><em>Note to myself: Canvas needs js</em></p>
<h4>Multimedia</h4>
<p>Some demoes using the audio and video tags and fallbacks for formats.</p>
<h4>Connectivity</h4>
<p><em>Not sure what was demoed ???</em></p>
<h4>Device Access</h4>
<p>The folks explained about achieving native drag and drop and the usage of the File Systems API. There was a really cool demo of a Html5 terminal using file systems API and drag drop. There were also demoes about a web based file directory browser and a great demo on using the device orientation which feeds the parameters using alpha, beta and gamma. There were also demoes on how to use the <em>navigator, geolocation and xspeech</em>.</p>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>There were quite a few tags being introduced and other modifications to streamline the web such as new input types for color,date etc., and new input constraints. They also explained about the changes to the Selector API.</p>
<h4>Offline</h4>
<p>They discussed briefly on the online and offline handlers network and local/session storage</p>
<h4>Performance and Integration</h4>
<p>There was a simple demo of application cache and explanation about the Web sockets and the History API which can now push and pop states to govern the back button of the browser.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, it was a day well spent though many topics seemed targetted for a fresh audience rather than professionals. However, shedding some light into the content earlier and better facilities would surely make the next gday a grander success.</p>
