    <div class="content">
        <p>This lecture introduces the GLove model, the intuition behind the
algorithm and different means to evaluate them.</p>
<p>Glove was an algorithm for word vectors that was made by Jeffrey
Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher Manning in 2014 and acted as
the starting point of connecting together the linear algebra based
methods on co-occurrence matrices like LSA and COALS with the models
like skip-gram, CBOW and others, which were iterative neural updating
algorithms. The earlier linear algebra methods actually had their
advantages for fast training and efficient usage of statistics, the
results weren&rsquo;t as good perhaps because of disproportionate importance
given to large counts in the main. Conversely, the neural models seemed
to performing gradient updates on word-windows, and inefficiently using
statistics versus the co-occurrence matrix. Though, it was actually
easier to scale to a very large corpus by trading time for space.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_count_prediction.png"/></p>
<p>The motivation was to use neural methods, which generated improved
performance on many taskss, and identify the properties necessary to
have these analogies work, such as going from male to female, queen to
king. Or going from a verb to its agent, truck to driver.</p>
<h3 id="analogies-and-meaning-components">Analogies and Meaning
components</h3>
<p>The intent behind the Glove design was to represent the &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;
components as ratios of co-occurrence probabilities. As an example, the
below illustrates the spectrum from solid to gas as in physics. The word
&ldquo;solid&rdquo; co-occurs with the word &ldquo;ice&rdquo; often, while the word &ldquo;gas&rdquo;
doesn&rsquo;t occur with the word &ldquo;ice&rdquo; as many times. But the problem is the
word &ldquo;water&rdquo; will also occur a lot with ice, while any other random word
like the word &ldquo;fashon&rdquo;, doesn&rsquo;t occur with the word &ldquo;ice&rdquo; many times. In
contrast, if we look at words co-occurring with the word &ldquo;steam&rdquo;,
&ldquo;solid&rdquo; won&rsquo;t occur with &ldquo;steam&rdquo; many times, but &ldquo;gas&rdquo; will. The water
will also co-occur again and &ldquo;fashion&rdquo; occurence will be small. So to
determine the meaning component of traversing from gas to solid, it
would be useful to look at the ratio of these co-occurrence
probabilities.</p>
<p>Because then we get a spectrum from large to small between solid and
gas. Whereas for water and a random word, it basically cancels out and
gives youI just wrote these numbers in.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_meaning_components.png"/></p>
<p>In an actual large corpus, the following are actual co-occurrence
probabilities.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_cooccurence_probabilities.png"/></p>
<p>as noted the co-occurence probabilities cancel out for &ldquo;water&rdquo; and
while for fashion is it low, both around 1. Whereas the ratio of
probability of co-occurrence of solid with ice or steam is about 10. And
for gas it&rsquo;s about a 10th.</p>
<h4 id="log-bi-linear-model">Log bi-linear model</h4>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/log_bilinear.png"/></p>
<p>In order to capture these ratios of co-occurrence probabilities as
linear meaning components within the word vector space, we can just add
and subtract linear meaning components. This can be achieved using a
log-bilinear model. So that <strong>the dot product between two word
vectors attempts to approximate the log of the probability of
co-occurrence.</strong> So if you do that, you then get this property
that the difference between two vectors, its similarity to another word
corresponds to the log of the probability ratio shown on the previous
figure.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_loss_fn.png"/></p>
<p>So the GloVe model attempts to unify the thinking between the
co-occurrence matrix models and the neural models by being some way
similar to a neural model 1. calculated on top of a co-occurrence matrix
count. 2. Has an explicit loss function.</p>
<p>And the explicit loss function is the diference of the dot product to
the log of the co-occurrence. To prevent very common words from
dominating, the effect of high word counts are capped using the
<em>f</em> function. This structure allows the optimization of the
<em>J</em> function directly on the co-occurrence count matrix,
providing a fast training scalable to huge corpora.</p>
<h4 id="objective-function-for-the-glove-model-log-bilinear-means">Objective
function for the GloVe model / log-bilinear means</h4>
<p><strong>log-bilinear</strong> - the &ldquo;bi&rdquo; is indicative of the two
terms <em>wi</em> and <em>wj</em>, similar to an algebraic value of
<em>ax</em> where the term i linear in <em>x</em> and <em>a</em> is a
constant. The difference is squared to ensure that the term is always
positive and J is a minimization problem. There are two bias terms for
both words which can move things up and down for the word in general. So
if in general probabilities are high for a certain word, this bias term
can model specifically for that word.</p>
<h4 id="explanation-for-fxij">Explanation for f(Xij)</h4>
<p><em>f(Xij)</em> is provided to scale things depending on the
frequency of a word because we want to pay more attention to words that
are more common or word pairs that are more common. But there is a
potential issue when we have extremely common words like function words.
So the function <em>f(Xij)</em> typically pays attention to words that
co-occurred together up until a certain point. And then the curve just
goes flat, so it didn&rsquo;t matter if it was even an extremely, extremely
common word.</p>
<h3 id="results_1">Results</h3>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_frog_results.png"/></p>
<p>Nearest words to the word &ldquo;frog&rdquo; - We get &ldquo;frogs&rdquo;, &ldquo;toad&rdquo;, and then
we get some complicated words. But it turns out they are all frogs,u
ntil we get down to lizards.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation-of-glove-algorithm">Evaluation of Glove
algorithm</h3>
<p>There are typically two ways of evaluation - Intrinsic and extrinsic.
In an intrinsic evaluation we evaluate directly on the specific or
intermediate subtasks that we&rsquo;ve been working on. Intrinsic evaluations
are fast to compute and help understand the component we&rsquo;ve been working
on.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_evaluate.png"/></p>
<p>An extrinsic evaluation is to utilize a real task of interest, such
as web search or machine translation and use that goal to improve
performance on that task. However, such evaluation takes longer due to
the extensiveness of the system involved. And sometimes it is difficult
to attribute the result to the appropriateness of the word vectors or
due to some other components of the system or if the interaction was
just better with your previous version of the word vectors.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_intrinsic.png"/></p>
<p>For intrinsic evaluation of word vectors, we can provide models with
a big collection of word vector analogy problems, such as man is to
woman as king is to blank? And tune the model to find the word that is
closest, such as queen and produce an accuracy score of how often that
the model evaluates it accurately.</p>
<p>Note: Many times during such evaluation, the actual closest word is
really just &ldquo;king&rdquo;. So to prevent this issue, the three input words are
not allowed in the selection process, choosing only the nearest word
that isn&rsquo;t one of the input words.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_viz_1.png"/></p>
<p>From the GloVe vector examples above, they exhibit a strong linear
component property such as the male-female dimension. For example,
taking the vector difference of &ldquo;man&rdquo; and &ldquo;woman&rdquo; and adding the vector
difference onto &ldquo;brother&rdquo;, the expectation is to get to &ldquo;sister&rdquo; and
king, queen, and for many of these examples. But some examples may not
work, such as starting from &ldquo;emperor&rdquo;, the vector might get to
&ldquo;countess&rdquo; or &ldquo;duchess&rdquo; instead.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_viz_2.png"/></p>
<p>And these two examples illustrate that the Company to CEO and
superlatives also move in roughly linear components.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_viz_3.png"/></p>
<h3 id="evaluation-metrics">Evaluation Metrics</h3>
<p>word2vec authors built a data set of analogies to evaluate different
models on the accuracy of their analogies, including semantic and
syntactic analogies. Unscaled co-occurrence counts via an SVD work
terribly. Some scaling can get SVD of a scaled count matrix to work
reasonably well, hence SVD-L is similar to the COALS model. They do a
decent enough job without a neural network.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_eval_results.png"/></p>
<p>The results also illustrate how word2vec and GloVe models performed
and in 2014 was considered optimal. However, it might have scored better
due to better data.</p>
<h3 id="better-data">Better Data</h3>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_analogy_data.png"/></p>
<p>The above image illustrates the semantic, syntactic and overall
performance on word analogies of GloVe modelthat when trained on
different subsets of data. One of the big advantage was that the GloVe
model was partly trained on Wikipedia as well as other text. Whereas the
word2vec model that was released was trained exclusively on Google News,
which is not as good as even one quarter of the size amount of Wikipedia
data for semantics. On the right end, with Common Crawl Web data, 42
billion words, we get good scores again from the semantic side.</p>
<p>The graph on the right then shows performance against the vector
dimension. 25 dimensional vectors score poorly, while 100 dimensional
vectors already work reasonably well, but still get significant gains
for 200 and somewhat to 300 and recently 300 dimensional vectors seems
to be the sweet spot, with the best known sets of word vectors,
including the word2vec vectors and the GloVe vectors provide 300
dimensional word vectors.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_intrinsic_eval_2.png"/></p>
<h3 id="human-judgments-of-word-similarity">Human judgments of word
similarity</h3>
<p>Another intrinsic evaluation you can do is see how these models model
human judgments of word similarity. So psychologists for several decades
have actually taken human judgments of word similarity. Where literally
you&rsquo;re asking people for pairs of words like &ldquo;professor&rdquo; and &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; to
give them a similarity score that&rsquo;s being measured as some continuous
quantity giving you a score between, say 0 and 10.</p>
<p>They responses are then averaged over multiple human judgments as to
how similar different words are. For example, &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; and &ldquo;cat&rdquo; are
pretty similar. &ldquo;Computer&rdquo; and &ldquo;internet&rdquo; are pretty similar, while
&ldquo;Plane&rdquo; and &ldquo;cars&rdquo; less similar. &ldquo;Stock&rdquo; and &ldquo;CD&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t very similar at
all but &ldquo;stock&rdquo; and &ldquo;jaguar&rdquo; are even less similar.</p>
<p><img src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_correlation.png"/></p>
<p>And in particular, we can measure a <strong>correlation coefficient
</strong>of whether they give the same ordering of similarity judgments.
And there are various different data sets of word similarities and
scorinf of different models as to how well they do on such similarities.
Plain SVD&rsquo;s works comparatively better here for similarities than it did
for analogies, not completely terrible because we no longer need that
linear property. Scaled SVD&rsquo;s work a lot better, Word2vec works a bit
better than that and with similar minor advantages from the GloVe
model.</p>
<h3 id="extrinisic-evaluation">Extrinisic Evaluation</h3>
<p>NER (named entity recognition) is an extrinsic task for identifying
mentions of a person&rsquo;s name or an organization name like a company or a
location. Having good word vectors help perform named entity recognition
effectively. Starting with a model with discrete features, which uses
word identity as features, we can build a named entity model doing that
and adding word vectors provides a better representation of the meaning
of words. <img alt="Glove NER" src="/extras/images/nlp-glove-algorithm/glove_ner.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13928.pdf">On the Intrinsic and
Extrinsic Fairness Evaluation Metrics for Contextualized Language
Representations</a> <em>by Yang Trista Cao et al.</em> is a good
reference on these different evaluation metrics and underlying
biases.</p>

<h3 id="word-senses-and-word-sense-ambiguity">Word Senses and word sense
ambiguity</h3>
<p>There are different meanings of the word pike</p>
<ul>
<li>A sharp point or staff</li>
<li>A type of elongated fish</li>
<li>A railroad line or system</li>
<li>A type of road</li>
<li>The future (coming down the pike)</li>
<li>A type of body position (as in diving)</li>
<li>To kill or pierce with a pike</li>
<li>To make one&rsquo;s way (pike along)</li>
<li>In Australian English, pike means to pull out from doing something:
I reckon he could have climbed that cliff, but he piked!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="improving-word-representations-via-global-context-and-multiple-word-prototypes-huang-et-al.-2012">Improving
Word Representations Via Global Context And Multiple Word Prototypes
(Huang et al.&nbsp;2012)</h4>
<p>The gut feeling is usually to have different vectors for each meaning
of the same word, as it seems counter-intutive to have the same vector
for all the different meanings. If &ldquo;Pike&rdquo;, and other words have
<strong>&ldquo;word sense&rdquo;</strong> vectors. This paper attempted to improve
the representation of words such as &ldquo;pike&rdquo;. The primary idea was to
cluster word windows around words, retrain with each word assigned to
multiple different clusters bank1, bank2, etc. And then for the clusters
of word tokens, start treating them as if they were separate words and
learning a word vector for each. So basically this does work and we can
learn word vectors for different senses of a word. But actually this
isn&rsquo;t the majority way that things have then gone in practice. Primarily
due to increased complexity, and it tends to be imperfect in its own way
as we&rsquo;re trying to take all the uses of the word &ldquo;pike&rdquo; and sort of cut
them up into key different senses, where differences overlap and there
is no clear distinction. It&rsquo;s always very unclear how you cut word
meaning into different senses.</p>
<p>In an overall sense, the word vector is generated as a superposition
of the word vectors for the different senses of a word, here
&ldquo;superposition&rdquo; means no more or less a weighted sum. So the vector that
we learn for &ldquo;pike&rdquo; will be a weighted average of the vectors that would
have learned for the medieval weapons sense, plus the fish sense, plus
the road sense, plus whatever other senses that you have, <strong>where
the weighting that&rsquo;s given to these different sense vectors corresponds
to the frequencies of use of the different senses.</strong></p>
<p>And adding up several different vectors into an average does not lose
the real meanings of the word and it turns out that this average vector
in applications, tends to self-disambiguate.</p>
