</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>What industry sites and blogs do you read regularly? This question
can give you an idea of how in-tune they are with the latest industry
trends and technologies, as well as how passionate they are about
webdev. It&rsquo;ll help separate the people who do it as a career AS WELL as
a hobby from those who might simply be in it for the big developer
paychecks. _</li>
<li>Do you prefer to work alone or on a team? This is an important
question to ask depending on the work environment. If your project is
going to require close interaction with other developers it&rsquo;s very handy
to have someone who has had that kind of experience. On the other hand,
many developers thrive while going solo. Try to find a developer that
fits your needs. _</li>
<li>How comfortable are you with writing HTML entirely by hand?
(+exercise) Although their resume may state that they&rsquo;re an HTML expert,
often times many developers can&rsquo;t actually write an HTML document from
top to bottom. They rely on an external publisher or have to constantly
flip back to a reference manual. Any developer worth a damn should at
least be able to write a simple HTML document without relying on
external resources. A possible exercise is to draw up a fake website and
ask them to write the HTML for it. Keep it simple and just make sure
they have the basics down - watch for mistakes like forgetting the
<head>
</head>
tags or serious misuse of certain elements. If they write something
like: <image src="/some/image.gif"/>, it might be a good hint to wrap
things up and call the next interviewee. _</li>
<li>What is the w3c? Standards compliance in web development is where
everything is (hopefully?) going. Don&rsquo;t ask them to recite the w3c&rsquo;s
mission statement or anything, but they should at least have a general
idea of who they are. _</li>
<li>Can you write table-less XHTML? Do you validate your code? Weed out
the old-school table-driven design junkies! Find a developer who uses
HTML elements for what they were actually intended. Also, many
developers will say they can go table-less, but when actually building
sites they still use tables out of habit and/or convenience. Possibly
draw up a quick navigation menu or article and have them write the
markup for it. To be tricky, you could draw up tabular data - give them
bonus points if they point out that a table should be used in that
scenario :) _</li>
<li>What are a few of your favorite development tools and why? If they
say notepad you&rsquo;ve obviously got the wrong person for the job. Not only
can this help you gauge their level of competence, but it&rsquo;ll also see if
they match the tools everyone else uses in-house. _</li>
<li>Describe/demonstrate your level of competence in a *nix shell
environment See how well they work without their precious GUI. Ask some
basic questions like how they would recursively copy a directory from
one place to another, or how you&rsquo;d make a file only readable by the
owner. Find out what OSs they have experience with. _</li>
<li>What skills and technologies are you the most interested in
improving upon or learning? Find out if their future interests match the
direction of the position (or the company in general). _</li>
<li>Show me your portfolio! A portfolio can say a lot about a developer.
Do they have an eye for aesthetics? Are they more creatively or
logically oriented? The most important thing is to look for is solid,
extensive, COMPLETED projects. A half dozen mockups and/or hacked-out
scripts is a sign of inexperience or incompetence. _</li>
<li>What sized websites have you worked on in the past? Find a developer
that has experience similar in size to the project you&rsquo;re putting
together. Developers with high traffic, large scale site expertise may
offer skills that smaller-sized developers don&rsquo;t, such as fine tuning
apache or optimizing heavily hit SQL queries. On the other hand,
developers who typically build smaller sites may have an eye for things
that large scale developers don&rsquo;t, such as offering a greater level of
visual creativity. _</li>
<li>Show me your code! Whether it&rsquo;s plain old HTML or freakishly
advanced ruby on rails, ask for code samples. Source code can say more
about a persons work habits than you think. Clean, elegant code can
often be indicative of a methodical, capable developer. A resume may say
7+ years of perl experience, but that could mean 7 years of bad,
unreadable perl. Also, make sure you ask for a lot of source code, not
just a few isolated functions or pieces of HTML. Anyone can clean up
20-30 lines of code for an interview, you want to see the whole shebang.
Don&rsquo;t ask for a full, functional app, but make sure it&rsquo;s enough that you
can tell it&rsquo;s really what their code is like. _</li>
<li>What are a few sites you admire and why? (from a webdev perspective)
Find out what inspires them. While it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily &ldquo;take one to
know one,&rdquo; a great developer should always have a few impressive
favorites. _</li>
<li>Fix this code, please. Give them some broken code written in the
development language they are expected to know for the position. Have
them go through it line by line and point out all the mistakes. _</li>
<li>I just pulled up the website you built and the browser is displaying
a blank page. Walk me through the steps you&rsquo;d take to troubleshoot the
problem. This is a great question to determine how well rounded their
abilites are. It tests everything from basic support skills all the way
up to troubleshooting the webserver itself. _</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your favorite development language and why? What other
features (if any) do you wish you could add to this language? Asking
about feature additions is a particularly valuable question - it can
reveal if they&rsquo;re skilled in programming in general or if their skillset
is pigeonholed into their language of choice. _</li>
<li>Do you find any particular languages or technologies intimidating?
I&rsquo;ve often felt that the more I learn, the less I feel like I know.
Solving one mystery opens up ten others. Having the interviewee tell you
their faults can reveal a lot about what they know. _</li>
<li>Acronym time (oh boy!) Some might argue that knowing what acronyms
actually stand for is trivial, but there are certain acronyms that a
developer should have hard-wired into their head ( HTML or CSS, for
example). This is the kind of question that might be better reserved for
the phone interview to weed out those who are very unqualified. _</li>
<li>What web browser do you use? There is a right answer to this
question: all of them. A competent developer should be familiar with
testing cross-browser compatibility by using all the major web browsers.
Obviously they&rsquo;ll have a primary browser they use for surfing, but their
answer to this question might be a good way for you to segue to asking
how extensively they test cross-browser issues. Also, if it&rsquo;s some kind
of css/html position seeing what toolbars they have installed can be a
good metric of their skillset (I personally find the web developer
toolbar for firefox to be invaluable) _</li>
<li>Rank your interest in these development tasks from 1 to 5 (1 being
not interested at all, 5 being extremely interested) Write up a list of
tasks the job requires. Having them rank these items according to their
interest level can help you find who is the best suited for the
position. I know debugging uncommented perl code from 1997 sounds
seriously awesome to me. _</li>
<li>What are a few personal web projects you&rsquo;ve got going on? Almost all
developers have personal web projects they like to plug away at in their
spare time. This is another question that can help differentiate the
passionate developers from the clock-punchers. It&rsquo;s also a good question
to end an interview with, as it&rsquo;s usually easy (and fun) for them to
answer.</li>
