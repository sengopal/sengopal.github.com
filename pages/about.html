      <h1>  About me
</h1>
      <hr>
  <article class="article">
    <div class="content">
      <p>I am a technologist and an avid engineer focused on building solutions for complex problems and building efficient architectures and applications. I have the good fortune of working on different domaind such as eCommerce, Banking and Insurance and have built technology solutions for highly scalable and always available web based products, services and architecting frameworks with high fidelity for business prerogatives. </p>
<p>My current work and research in comprehending user provided content, specifically around unstructured item and inventory information aiding in improving information retrieval for eBay search. My work focuses on building and tuning ML models to understand and qualify item and inventory data to assist in improving search quality, create feedback loop for sellers to understand the importance of their content and drive for clarity and conversion, for building new experiences and other work flows in eBay. My primary focus is on applying modern machine learning technologies and research to improve the comprehension of Item/Inventory and build semi-supervised and supervised ML models for various content related work around aspects comprehension and quality, image quality and coherence of various measures around item inventory.</p>
<hr/>

<p>I received my Masters in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/school-computational-science-and-engineering" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a> with specialization in Machine Learning.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Ealier, I developed multiple Identity Infrastructure products such as Identity Linking Platform, OAuth management, Secure Token Authentication systems and Federated Identity which form the critical platform components of flows such as checkout, search etc., in eBay with focus on security and availability. I also built end to end solutions for integrating social identity providers in eBay ecosystem, creating a single use code authentication platform, redesigning authentication tokens data model and overall Identity architecture.  During this period I also worked on PCI DSS compliance, Encryption standards, OAuth standards, OpenID Connect protocol and intelligent ATO prevention and bot attack mitigation measures.</p>
<p>I worked on multiple designs and development of Identity Architecture for eBay building Authentication platform products, next generation of API authentication protocols, Identity enablement systems, their data architecture and other elements of the authentication ecosystem.</p>
<p>During my tenure as the engineering leader in Toronto, I managed multiple teams for integrating <a href="https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/new-improved-terapeak-research-2-0-in-ebay-seller-hub/" target="_blank">Terapeak Research Analytics</a> platform into eBay marketplaces. The multi fold architecture accomplishes an end-to-end data processing pipeline and application architecture for loading data and to garner better insights to sellers on a near real-time basis.</p>
<p>Subsequently I was managing the Seller Marketing platform at eBay and leading the engineering teams responsible for one of the most critical components of eBay marketplace which has touchpoints all over the seller and buyer experiences including search, view item, checkout, orders etc., including the most recent product release of <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/seller-updates/2021-spring/listing.html#coded-coupons" target="_blank">Seller Coded Coupons</a>. This platform had a very wide range of capabilities for sellers and buyers for promotion lifecycle management, checkout and cart redemption and the whole end to end pipeline for promotional integration in ecommerce.</p>
