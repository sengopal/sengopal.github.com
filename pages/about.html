      <h1>  About me
</h1>
      <hr>
  <article class="article">
    <div class="content">
      <p>I am a machine learning researcher, technologist and an avid engineer
focused on identifying and building creative solutions and teams to
solve for complex problems. I had the good fortune of working on various
technologies from highly scalable and available web based products, end
to end services and architecting frameworks, machine learning algorithms
and currently learning hardware-software co-design for ML
acceleration.</p>
<p>I am currently leading the ML Framework Extension (for PyTorch,
TensorFlow and JAX) for Inference acceleration using AWS Trainium and
Inferentia Accelerator chips managing team of machine learning engineers
driving critical projects for internal (Bedrock, Alexa) and external
customers for onboarding their deep learning models and support several
large Enterprise customers on Neuron based accelerator instances. I am
responsible for adoption of leading LLM models such as LLamav2, Mistral,
GPTJ and other Gen AI models such as GPT-NeoX and BLOOM, saving training
and inference costs over comparable GPU-based EC2 instances. I am
driving NeuronX Distributed library for customers to parallelize large
models across training and inference tasks using tensor/sequence and
pipeline parallelism.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I received my Masters in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/school-computational-science-and-engineering">Georgia
Tech</a> with specialization in Machine Learning.</p>
<hr/>
<p>My recent work and research in recommendation systems involved
comprehending user provided content, specifically around unstructured
item and inventory information aiding in improving information retrieval
for eBay search. My work focused on building and tuning ML models to
understand and qualify item and inventory data to assist in improving
search quality, create feedback loop for sellers to understand the
importance of their content and drive for clarity and conversion, and
build new experiences and workflows in eBay. My primary focus was on
applying modern machine learning technologies and research to improve
the comprehension of Item/Inventory and build semi-supervised and
supervised ML models for various content related work around aspects
understanding and quality, image quality controls and coherence of
various measures around item inventory.</p>
<p>Earlier in my career, I developed multiple Identity Infrastructure
products such as Identity Linking Platform, OAuth management, Secure
Token Authentication systems and Federated Identity which form the
critical platform components of flows such as checkout, search etc., in
eBay with focus on security and availability. I also built end to end
solutions for integrating social identity providers in eBay ecosystem,
creating a single use code authentication platform, redesigning
authentication tokens data model and overall Identity architecture.
During this period I also worked on PCI DSS compliance, Encryption
standards, OAuth standards, OpenID Connect protocol and intelligent ATO
prevention and bot attack mitigation measures.</p>
<p>I worked on multiple designs and development of Identity Architecture
for eBay building Authentication platform products, next generation of
API authentication protocols, Identity enablement systems, their data
architecture and other elements of the authentication ecosystem.</p>
<p>During my tenure as the engineering leader in Toronto, I managed
multiple teams for integrating <a href="https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/new-improved-terapeak-research-2-0-in-ebay-seller-hub/">Terapeak
Research Analytics</a> platform into eBay marketplaces. The multi fold
architecture accomplishes an end-to-end data processing pipeline and
application architecture for loading data and to garner better insights
to sellers on a near real-time basis.</p>
<p>Subsequently I was managing the Seller Marketing platform at eBay and
leading the engineering teams responsible for one of the most critical
components of eBay marketplace which has touchpoints all over the seller
and buyer experiences including search, view item, checkout, orders
etc., including the most recent product release of <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/seller-updates/2021-spring/listing.html#coded-coupons">Seller
Coded Coupons</a>. This platform had a very wide range of capabilities
for sellers and buyers for promotion lifecycle management, checkout and
cart redemption and the whole end to end pipeline for promotional
integration in ecommerce.</p>
