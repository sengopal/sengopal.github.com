<p>A scalar subquery is a query that returns exactly one value: a single row, with a single column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A subquery is a query that is nested inside a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement or inside another subquery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subqueries can be nested to an unlimited depth in a FROM clause but to "only" 255 levels in a WHERE clause. They can be used in the SELECT list and in the FROM, WHERE, and HAVING clauses of a query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using NOT IN is fraught with problems because of the way SQL handles NULLs. As a general rule, do not use NOT IN unless you are certain that the result set will not include a NULL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the subquery is going to return more than one row, then the comparison operator must be able to accept multiple values. These operators are IN, NOT IN, ANY, and ALL. If the comparison operator is EQUAL, GREATER THAN, or LESS THAN (which each can only accept one value), the parent query will fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An extension of the use of subqueries as an alternative to a join is to enable the star transformation often needed in data warehouse applications</p>

<p>There is a significant deviation from the ISO standard for SQL here, in that ISO SQL uses EXCEPT where Oracle uses MINUS, but the functionality is identical.</p>

<li>
<p>Oracle provides three set operators: UNION, INTERSECT, and MINUS. UNION can be qualified with ALL</p>

<p>INTERSECT - Returns only the rows that occur in both queriesâ€™ result sets, sorting them and removing duplicates.</p>

<li>
<p>MINUS - Returns only the rows in the first result set that do not appear in the second result set, sorting them and removing duplicates.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Although pending enhancements to ISO SQL will give INTERSECT a higher priority than the others, there is currently no priority of one operator over another.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>To override this precedence, based on the order in which the operators appear, you can use parentheses:</p>

<p>The columns in the queries that make up a compound query can have different names, but the output result set will use the names of the columns in the first query</p>

<li>
<p>Each query in a compound query will project its own list of selected columns.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>These lists must have the same number of elements, be nominated in the same sequence, and be of broadly similar data type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They do not have to have the same names (or column aliases), nor do they need to come from the same tables (or subqueries).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the column names (or aliases) are different, the result set of the compound query will have columns named as they were in the first query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the selected column lists do not have to be exactly the same data type, they must be from the same data type group.</p>

<li>
<p>DATE amd NUMBER in first query should match with TIMESTAMP and INTEGER in second Query</p>

<p>INSTERSECT between CHAR and VARCHAR2 will not be equal [Exact number of spaces is required in VARCHAR2 field]</p>

<p>MERGE can be thought of as a shortcut for executing either an INSERT or an UPDATE or a DELETE, depending on some condition.</p>

<p>Final List of DML Statements are:  SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TRUNCATE is thought as a DML but actually is a DDL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are much faster techniques than INSERT for populating a table with large numbers of rows. These are the SQL*Loader utility, which can upload data from files produced by an external feeder system, and Datapump, which</p>

<li>
<p>One UPDATE statement can change rows in only one table, but it can change any number of rows in that table.</p>

<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">

<p>TRUNCATE is a DDL and NOT A DML because it cannot be controlled by Transactions [(though within the database, they are in fact implemented as transactions, but developers cannot control them]</p>

<li>
<p>Whereas a deletion may take some time (possibly hours, if there are many rows in the table) a truncation will go through instantly. It makes no difference whether the table contains one row or billions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DDL commands, such as TRUNCATE, will fail if there is any DML command active on the table. A transaction will block the DDL command until the DML command is terminated with a COMMIT or a ROLLBACK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the user attempting to execute the statement does not have the relevant permissions on the tables to which it refers, the database will return an error identical to that which would be returned if the object did not exist. As far as the user is concerned, it does not exist</p>

<p>An oddity of unique constraints is that it is possible to enter a NULL value into the key column(s); it is indeed possible to have any number of rows with NULL values in their key column(s)</p>

<p>Unique constraints are enforced by an index. When a unique constraint is defined, Oracle will look for an index on the key column(s), and if one does not exist it will be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The structure of these indexes (known as B*Tree indexes) does not include NULL values, which is why many rows with NULL are permitted: they simply do not exist in the index.</p>

<p>A table can have only one primary key. Try to create a second, and you will get an error. A table can, however, have any number of unique constraints and not null columns,</p>

<p>Types of indexes &#8594;  B*Tree index, which is the default index type, and the Bitmap Index</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B*Tree indexes: these can be either unique or nonunique. &#8594; Nonunique is the default. &#8594; "B" stands for "balanced"</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>A unique index will not permit insertion of two rows with the same key values;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a nonunique index will permit as many rows as you want with the same values.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indexes will improve performance for data retrieval but reduce performance for DML operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B*tree Index</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>The root node of the tree points to many nodes at the second level, which can point to many nodes at the third level, and so on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The necessary depth of the tree will be largely determined by the number of rows in the table and the length of the index key values.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The B*Tree structure is very efficient. If the depth is greater then three or four, than either the index keys are very long or the table has billions of rows.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>If neither if these is the case, then the index is in need of a rebuild.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The leaf nodes of the index tree store the rowsâ€™ keys, in order, each with a pointer that identifies the physical location of the row</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pointer to the row is the rowid &#8594;  Oracle proprietary pseudocolumn that every row in every table has</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Encrypted within it is the physical address of the row.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>ROWID: A rowâ€™s rowid is globally unique. Every row in every table in the whole database will have a different rowid.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>The rowid encryption gives the physical address of the row: from it, Oracle can calculate which operating system file and where in the file the row is, and go straight to it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>B*Tree indexes are very efficient if the number of rows needed is low in proportion to the total number of rows in the table and if the table is large</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often said that if the query is going to retrieve more than 2 to 4 percent of the rows, then a full table scan will be quicker.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>A major exception to this is if the value specified in the WHERE clause is NULL. NULLs do not go into B*Tree indexes</p>

<li>
<p>select * from employees where last_name is null; &#8594; ALWAYS A FULL TABLE SCAN</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>B*Tree index should not be used:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>On a column with few unique values, as it will not be selective:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proportion of the table that will be retrieved for each distinct key value will be too high</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>B*Tree indexes should be used if:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>The cardinality (the number of distinct values) in the column is high, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of rows in the table is high, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The column is used in WHERE clauses or JOIN conditions</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Bitmap Index stores the rowids associated with each key value as a bitmap</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>WALKIN    11010111000101011101011101â€¦..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DELIVERY  00101000111010100010100010â€¦..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that the first row has the column value of WALKIN, Second row as WALKIN, Third as DELIVERY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So every different value will be a bitmap, this includes NULLS as well which will be a seperate bitmap</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>select count(*) from sales where channel='WALKIN' and shop='OXFORD';</code></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Oracle can retrieve the two relevant bitmaps and add them together with a Boolean AND operation:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The result of the AND operation shows that only the seventh and sixteenth rows qualify for selection</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>A particular advantage that bitmap indexes have over B*Tree indexes is that they include NULLs. As far as the bitmap index is concerned, NULL is just another distinct value, which will have its own bitmap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bitmap indexes should be used if:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>The cardinality (the number of distinct values) in the column is low (such as male/female), and</p>

<p>A unique and primary key constraint can be enforced by indexes that are either unique or nonunique:</p>

<p>The Oracle server should make the best decision about index use, but if it gets it wrong it is possible for a programmer to embed instructions, known as OPTIMIZER HINTS, in code that will force the use (or not) of certain indexes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ALTER INDEX command lies in the database administration domain and would typically be used to adjust the physical properties of the index, not the logical properties that are of interest to developers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a table is dropped, all the indexes and constraints defined for the table are dropped as well.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>If an index was created implicitly by creating a constraint, then dropping the constraint will also drop the index.</p>

<li>
<p>If the index had been created explicitly and the constraint created later, then if the constraint is dropped the index will survive.</p>

<p>Bitmap indexes cannot be unique. The keywords BITMAP and UNIQUE are mutually exclusive</p>
