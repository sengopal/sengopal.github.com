                <p>Last week, I had a great opportunity to attend the <a href="http://jugchennai.in/chennaijavasummit/">Chennai JUG summit</a> for the first time.
It was a pleasant surprise to find such a huge following to the group and the language. It started with the traditional lamp lighting and a hearty welcome by the group creator <strong>Raj Mahendra Hegde</strong>, whose passionate speech was very infecting. His group IGGUG caught everybody's attention and I for one will be enrolling in the group as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Kaushik Sathupadi</strong> had everyone enthralled with his presentation full of Bollywood and Hollywood scenes. It was fun and educating about how Java and JVM has evolved to great heights. It was a great presentation on Fanthom and the Tales framework that he is working on. His lines like "Make the compiler do more work and complain less" made people think why we are still stuck with Java.</p>
<p><strong>Mani Duraisamy</strong> - The best speaker for the day [IMHO] held everyone's attention with not only his Q&amp;A and pranks but also with his informative talk about how and why Cloud computing going to change the world [Though irony strikes with the recent Amazon EC2 failure]. His presentation was so good that I was looking forward for each slide. Quotes such as <code>Businesses shouldn't own software</code> and <code>Because "Owning is the root cause of all 'evil'"</code> really got everyone rooted with laughter and yet made folks get new ideas for their own/employing businesses.</p>
<p><strong>A.Senthil Nayagam</strong> - a very talented engineer who has this zest for languages spoke about Mirah, the next JVM language in the fold. He gave a wonderful comparison of where Ruby is lacking and how JVM and Ruby would be the best marriage for a software engineer. He showed how an open source language in its baby step looks like and an open invitation to participate in its growth.</p>
