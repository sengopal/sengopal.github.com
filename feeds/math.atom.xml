used for experimentation. The standard definition of p-value &lt;strong&gt;is
the probability that the null hypothesis is true.&lt;/strong&gt; p-value
represents the probability that the world (created with math equations),
gives evidence supporting the null hypothesis i.e., p-value shows how
consistent the data is with the null hypothesis. So a lower p-value,
ridicules the null hypothesis while a large p-value gives no reason to
change the default action based on the null hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="drug-test"&gt;Drug Test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using [1] as reference, in a Drug test between A and B, the null
hypothesis is that both Drugs A and B are the same. So a low p-value
shows that these two drugs are different, defeating the null hypothesis.
Typically a p-value of 0.05 is used as a threshold, though this is
arbitrary. A p-value of 0.05 means that on multiple runs of the
experiment, only 5% or less times would the null hypothesis would be
true, that both the drugs are same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Null Hypothesis: The drug are the same and patients react the same
way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate Hypothesis: The drugs are dissimilar and cures the disease
with varying degrees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="computing-p-value"&gt;Computing p-value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As referenced from [2], a different test is conducted where the same
drug A is being given to two different groups. Null Hypothesis: The drug
has no effect and groups would have different reactions Alternate
Hypothesis: The drug cures the disease and groups would be similar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the null hypothesis, the p-value would be higher as the
assumption is that both groups have been given the same drug and are
getting cured and hence there are no differences between these two
groups. Multiple runs might give a higher p-value proving that the
groups are cured and the effect of the drug A are same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But due to pure random effect, if the p-value of two groups having
the same drug, is small, say p=0.01, then it is a False Positive of the
Null Hypothesis. As our intent is to break the null hypothesis, this
particular experiment disproves the experiment and confirms the null
hypothesis for this particular round of experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with multiple experiments “A p=0.05 threshold means that 5% of the
experiments, where the differences come from random things, will
generate a p-value &amp;lt; 0.05”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this statement, for the test with Drug A vs Drug B, a p-value
of &amp;lt; 0.05 would mean that there is no difference between Drug A and
Drug B, since the different reactions might be just random. ie., we will
allow up to 5 False Positives in 100 experiment runs, to prove that Drug
A is different that Drug B. Any more false positives than 5, proves that
the null hypothesis is true based on this threshold. Hence it is
important to determine this p-value or threshold before running the
experiments to prevent being biased by the generated data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a stricter threshold, p=0.0001 might be used as well, where only
1 false positive is allowed in 10,000 experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="compute-the-difference"&gt;Compute the difference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, a p-value helps decide if the null hypothesis is true or not,
it does not provide a mechanism to determine how dissimilar the drugs
are. It is important to remember that p-value determines the probability
of the null hypothesis, but not the scale of difference in the
candidates of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;permutations, variations and combinations&lt;/strong&gt; which are
variations with subtle differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="permutation"&gt;Permutation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical question for permutation is “How many ways to arrange the
three characters a,b and c?”. Note that the position and order matters
for permutation and to fill all the positions. A permutation defines the
numbers of different possible ways we can arrange a set of elements and
can always &lt;strong&gt;arrange the entire set of elements in the sample
space&lt;/strong&gt;. Example: For a relay race, we can arrange 4-runners
already chosen in 4-positions using permutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permutations are arrangements of objects (with or without
repetition), the order does matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permutations without repetition if all elements are added and order
does matter with no repetition of elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permutations with repetition if all elements are added and order does
matter with repetition of elements being allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;$$
P^{a,b,c...}_{n} = \frac{n!}{(a! \cdot b! \cdot c! ...)}
$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="examples-of-permutations"&gt;Examples of Permutations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ways to put N items in a specific order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different strings that can be built using the 26 alphabets such that
each letter is used only once in a single string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order in which N people can enter a door&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="variations-extension-of-permutation"&gt;Variations (extension of
permutation)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations can be considered an extension of permutation where
variations determines the total number of ways we can pick and arrange
some elements of a given set, with or without repetitions. Using the
relay race example from above, if we had to choose 4-runners out of
6-runners in the team (6-runners | 4-positions), and then decide who
runs in which lap (**pick &amp;amp; arrange), we would require using
Variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations are arrangements of selections of objects, where the order
of the selected objects matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations without repetition if not all the elements are added and
order does matter with no repetition of elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;$$
V^n_{m} = \frac{m!}{(m - n)!}
$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations with repetition if not all elements are added if 𝑚 &amp;gt; 𝑛
and order does matter with repetition of elements being allowed. All
elements can be added if 𝑚 ≤ 𝑛.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;&lt;em&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Different results when rolling 3 dice which are distinguishable by
color, e.g. white, red, and black dice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="combinations"&gt;Combinations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of different ways we can pick a specific element of a set
where the order in which the elements needs to be selected is also not
important. Using the example of the relay race, if we only care about
which 4-runners out of 6-runners made it into the team
(&lt;strong&gt;pick&lt;/strong&gt;) without any dependency on their position, we
would be dealing with combinations and order is not relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combinations are selections of objects, with or without repetition,
the order does not matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combinations without repetition if not all elements are added and
order does not matter where &lt;strong&gt;elements are not
repeated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;$$
C^n_{𝑚} = \frac{𝑚!}{𝑛! \cdot (𝑚−𝑛)!}

does not matter where &lt;strong&gt;elements are repeated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;$$
C^n_{𝑚} = \frac{(𝑚 + n -1)!}{𝑛! \cdot (𝑚−1)!}

about statistical paradoxes and wanted to learn what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="absence-of-evidence-fallacy"&gt;Absence of evidence fallacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of evidence fallacy occurs when someone uses a lack of
evidence to try to “prove” something. Of course, the problem with this
line of reasoning is that a lack of evidence is just that: a lack.
Evidence of absence is evidence of any kind that suggests something is
missing or that it does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence"&gt;Reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ecological-fallacy"&gt;Ecological fallacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mistake caused by assuming what is true for a group is true for the
individual members of the group. (noun) In statistical analysis, an
error caused by inferring aggregate data remains true on an individual
level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sociologydictionary.org/ecological-fallacy/"&gt;Reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="steins-paradox"&gt;Stein’s paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stein’s example (or phenomenon or paradox), in decision theory and
estimation theory, is the phenomenon that when three or more parameters
are estimated simultaneously, there exist combined estimators more
accurate on average (that is, having lower expected mean squared error)
than any method that handles the parameters separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein%27s_example"&gt;Reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lords-paradox"&gt;Lord’s paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two groups are compared in a pre-post study, two different
conclusions can be drawn between the two-sample t-test and the analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA). It is known as Lord’s Paradox, and it occurs
because the parameter in the two-sample t-test and the parameter of
interest in the ANCOVA model are not the same quantity. The difference
between the two parameters can be explained by the covariance of
linearly combined random variables which is an important topic in
introductory statistical theory courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="simpsons-paradox"&gt;Simpson’s paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simpson’s paradox, which also goes by several other names, is a
phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in
several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are
combined. This result is often encountered in social-science and
medical-science statistics,[1][2][3] and is particularly problematic
when frequency data is unduly given causal interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox"&gt;Reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="berksons-paradox"&gt;Berkson’s paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkson’s paradox (also known as Berkson’s fallacy or Berkson’s bias)
is the counter-intuitive idea that events which seem to be correlated
actually are not. Take two events, A and B, which are completely
independent events (for example, lung cancer and diabetes). If a study
selects for both the presence of A (lung cancer) and B (diabetes), the
presence of diabetes will make the presence of lung cancer more likely.
Intuitively, this makes no sense, but the data seems to back this
counter-intuitive notion up, showing that there is, in fact, a
connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tbd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gamblers-fallacy"&gt;Gambler’s fallacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gambler’s fallacy is the belief that the probability for an
outcome after a series of outcomes is not the same as the probability
for a single outcome. The gambler’s fallacy is real and true in cases
where the events in question are independent and identically
distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="lindleys-paradox"&gt;Lindley’s paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindley’s paradox is a counterintuitive situation in statistics in
which the Bayesian and frequentist approaches to a hypothesis testing
problem give different results for certain choices of the prior
distribution. It is in fact a difficulty reconciling two paradigms —
Bayesian and frequentist statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bayes — probability is a (unique) measure of degree of belief (see
e.g., Cox’s theorem in Chap. 2 of Jaynes3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequentist — probability is the (asymptotic) frequency at which an
outcome occurs, in a hypothetical sequence of repeated trials&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id="low-birthweight-paradox"&gt;Low birthweight paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low birth-weight paradox is an apparently paradoxical observation
relating to the birth weights and mortality rate of children born to
tobacco smoking mothers. Low birth-weight children born to smoking
mothers have a lower infant mortality rate than the low birth weight
children of non-smokers. It is an example of Simpson’s paradox.
Traditionally, babies weighing less than a certain amount (which varies
between countries) have been classified as having low birth weight. In a
given population, low birth weight babies have a significantly higher
mortality rate than others; thus, populations with a higher rate of low
birth weights typically also have higher rates of child mortality than
other populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="from-wikipedia"&gt;From Wikipedia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem"&gt;Fermat’s
little theorem&lt;/a&gt; states that if p is a prime number, then for any
integer a, the number &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; − &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
is an integer multiple of p. In the notation of modular arithmetic, this
is expressed as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; (mod  &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the Fermat’s little theorum for modular arithmetic, we know
that &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick here is to make the power same as &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; − 1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can formulate that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;/sup&gt;3 − 1) ≡ 1 (mod  3)&lt;/span&gt;
which becomes &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod  3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;/sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2006&lt;/sup&gt;) ≡ 1 (mod  3)&lt;/span&gt;
i.e., &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2005&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;/sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2005&lt;/sup&gt;) (mod  3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the solution is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2006&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (mod  3) ≡ 1 (mod  3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="question-is-the-difference-between-530000-and-6123456-divisible-by-31"&gt;Question:
Is the difference between &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;5&lt;sup&gt;30000&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;6&lt;sup&gt;123456&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; divisible by 31&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Fermat’s little theorum we know that &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; − 1)&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; ≡ 1 (mod  &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
if &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; (mod  &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) ≠ 0&lt;/span&gt; and
k is a natural number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick here is to make the power same as &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; − 1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we know that, &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;5&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;/sup&gt;31 − 1)&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; = (5&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewriting the modular equation similar to Fermat’s little theorum
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;(5&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod  31)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second part, dividing 12346 by 30 gives a reminder of 6 and a
divisor of 4115. So the second part of the equation can be rewritten as,
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;6123456 = (6&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)(6&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4115&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Fermats little theorum &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;(6&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4115&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod  31)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves, &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;(6&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) (mod  31)&lt;/span&gt; to be computed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking this further,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;6&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ (6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) (mod  31)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;6&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ (5)(5)(5) (mod  31)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;6&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 125 (mod  31)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;6&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod  31)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the difference between &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;5&lt;sup&gt;30000&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;6&lt;sup&gt;123456&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; being divisible by 31 is
simply written as, &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;1 (mod  31) − 1 (mod  31) = 0 (mod  31)&lt;/span&gt; which
implies that it is indeed divisible by 31.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Math"></category><category term="math"></category><category term="fermat"></category><category term="modular-arithmetic"></category><category term="algorithms"></category><category term="learning"></category></entry></feed>
